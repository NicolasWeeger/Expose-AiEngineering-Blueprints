  abstract  = {Epilepsy is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system that predisposes individuals to experiencing recurrent seizures. It affects 3 million Americans and 50 million people world-wide. A seizure is a transient aberration in the brain's electrical activity that produces disruptive physical symptoms such as a lapse in attention and memory, a sensory hallucination, or a whole-body convulsion. Approximately 1 out of every 3 individuals with epilepsy continues to experience frequent seizures despite treatment with multiple anti-epileptic drugs. These intractable seizures pose a serious risk of injury, limit the independence and mobility of an individual, and result in both social isolation and economic hardship. This thesis presents novel technology intended to ease the burden of intractable seizures. At its heart is a method for computerized detection of seizure onset. The method uses machine learning to construct patient-specific classifiers that are capable of rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of seizure onset. The algorithm detects the onset of a seizure through analysis of the brain's electrical activity alone or in concert with other physiologic signals. When trained on 2 or more seizures and tested on 844 hours of continuous scalp EEG from 23 pediatric epilepsy patients, our algorithm detected 96\% of 163 test seizures with a median detection delay of 3 seconds and a median false detection rate of 2 false detections per 24 hour period.},

  abstract  = {The detection of seizures in epileptic patients via Electroencephalography (EEG) is an essential key to medical treatment. With the advances in deep learning, many approaches are proposed to tackle this problem. However, concerns such as performance, speed, and subject-independency should still be considered for practical application. Thus, we propose EEGWaveNet, a novel end-to-end multiscale convolutional neural network designed to address epileptic seizure detection. Our network utilizes trainable depth-wise convolutions as discriminative filters to simultaneously gather features from each EEG channel and separate the signal into multiscale resolution. Then, the spatial-temporal features are extracted from each scale for further classification. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EEGWaveNet, we evaluate the model in three datasets: CHB-MIT, TUSZ, and BONN. From the results, EEGWaveNet’s performance is comparable to other baseline methods in the subject-dependent approach and outperforms the others in subject-independent approaches. EEGWaveNet also has time complexity comparable to the compact EEGNet-8,2. Moreover, we transfer the model trained from the subject-independent approach and fine-tune it with a 1-h recording, significantly improving sensitivity and F1-score (Binary) compared to without fine-tuning. This article indicates the possibility of further developing this model and the fine-tuning methodology toward healthcare 5.0, where the AI aid clinicians in a manner of man–machine collaboration.},

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;Prediction of Epileptic seizures is highly imperative to improve the epileptic patient’s life. Epileptic seizures occur due to brain cells excessive abnormal activity that leads to unprovoked seizures and may occur without prior notice. Therefore, preventive measure that monitor and alert the possible occurrence of the seizures is paramount. Commercial and clinical available epileptic seizure computer aided detection system that utilized deep learning algorithms suffers from many challenges. These challenges ranges from low accuracy and precision, sensitive to artifacts and noise, among others. To enhance and increase the accuracy and optimal performance of these networks, this paper endeavor to investigate various optimization algorithm to optimized the network components and parameters in the developed incremental Principal Components Analysis based Long Short-Term Memory (Inc-PCA-LSTM) network for the detection and classification of Electroencephalograph (EEG) epileptic seizure signals based on the big data scenario. The model proved to be effective in the characterization of seven seizure events. The Adam, Elu, Orthogonal, and L1/L2 performed better than their counterparts in optimization functions, activation functions, initialization functions, and regularisation techniques respectively. The accuracy values of 97.5%, 97.5%, 98.4%, and 98.5% was obtained for each of the mentioned core components receptively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;},

* **Aufteilung der Eingabedaten**: Die EEG-Daten (die aus vielen Kanälen mit elektrischen Signalen des Gehirns bestehen) werden zuerst in kleinere Abschnitte aufgeteilt. In diesem Fall wird das gesamte EEG-Signal in kleine „Patches" (Abschnitte) unterteilt, die jeweils eine feste Größe haben. Diese Patches werden wie kleine Blöcke des gesamten Signals behandelt.

* **Umwandlung in Vektoren**: Jeder dieser Patches wird dann in einen Vektor mit fester Länge umgewandelt. Diese Vektoren sind im Grunde genommen numerische Repräsentationen der einzelnen Patches des EEG-Signals.

* **Hinzufügen eines speziellen Tokens**: Ein spezieller Token wird an den Anfang der Sequenz von Vektoren hinzugefügt. Dieser Token dient als Platzhalter für die finale Klassifikation, d.h., er wird später verwendet, um vorherzusagen, ob ein Anfall im EEG-Signal vorliegt oder nicht.

* **Positional Encoding**: Da Transformermodelle normalerweise mit Sequenzen arbeiten, die eine Reihenfolge haben (wie Worte in einem Satz), wird eine Positionsinformation zu jedem Vektor hinzugefügt, um die Reihenfolge der Patches zu markieren. Dies stellt sicher, dass das Modell weiß, an welcher Position jeder Patch im Originalsignal stand.

* **Verarbeitung im Transformer-Modell**: Die gesamte Sequenz, bestehend aus den Vektoren (einschließlich des speziellen Tokens), wird dann durch das Transformer-Modell geschickt. Das Modell verarbeitet diese Sequenz und achtet darauf, wie die Patches miteinander in Beziehung stehen, um die gewünschten Merkmale herauszufiltern.

* **Klassifikation**: Am Ende des Verarbeitungsprozesses wird der spezielle Token (den das Modell durch die Verarbeitung verändert hat) verwendet, um die finale Entscheidung zu treffen, ob ein Anfall im EEG-Signal erkannt wurde oder nicht.},

  abstract   = {Neurologists typically identify epileptic seizures from electroencephalograms (EEGs) by visual inspection. This process is often time-consuming, especially for EEG recordings that last hours or days. To expedite the process, a reliable, automated, and patient-independent seizure detector is essential. However, developing a patient-independent seizure detector is challenging as seizures exhibit diverse characteristics across patients and recording devices. In this study, we propose a patient-independent seizure detector to automatically detect seizures in both scalp EEG and intracranial EEG (iEEG). First, we deploy a convolutional neural network with transformers and belief matching loss to detect seizures in single-channel EEG segments. Next, we extract regional features from the channel-level outputs to detect seizures in multi-channel EEG segments. At last, we apply post-processing filters to the segment-level outputs to determine seizures' start and end points in multi-channel EEGs. Finally, we introduce the minimum overlap evaluation scoring as an evaluation metric that accounts for minimum overlap between the detection and seizure, improving upon existing assessment metrics. We trained the seizure detector on the Temple University Hospital Seizure (TUH-SZ) dataset and evaluated it on five independent EEG datasets. We evaluate the systems with the following metrics: sensitivity (SEN), precision (PRE), and average and median false positive rate per hour (aFPR/h and mFPR/h). Across four adult scalp EEG and iEEG datasets, we obtained SEN of 0.617-1.00, PRE of 0.534-1.00, aFPR/h of 0.425-2.002, and mFPR/h of 0-1.003. The proposed seizure detector can detect seizures in adult EEGs and takes less than 15[Formula: see text]s for a 30[Formula: see text]min EEG. Hence, this system could aid clinicians in reliably identifying seizures expeditiously, allocating more time for devising proper treatment.},

  abstract  = {OBJECTIVE
Long-term automatic detection of focal seizures remains one of the major challenges in epilepsy due to the unacceptably high number of false alarms from state-of-the-art methods. Our aim was to investigate to what extent a new patient-specific approach based on similarly occurring morphological electroencephalographic (EEG) signal patterns could be used to distinguish seizures from nonseizure events, as well as to estimate its maximum performance.


METHODS
We evaluated our approach on >5500 h of long-term EEG recordings using two public datasets: the PhysioNet.org Children's Hospital Boston-Massachusetts Institute of Technology (CHB-MIT) Scalp EEG database and the EPILEPSIAE European epilepsy database. We visually identified a set of similarly occurring morphological patterns (seizure signature) seen simultaneously over two different EEG channels, and within two randomly selected seizures from each individual. The same seizure signature was then searched for in the entire recording from the same patient using dynamic time warping (DTW) as a similarity metric, with a threshold set to reflect the maximum sensitivity our algorithm could achieve without false alarm.


RESULTS
At a DTW threshold providing no false alarm during the entire recordings, the mean seizure detection sensitivity across patients was 84%, including 96% for the CHB-MIT database and 74% for the European epilepsy database. A 100% sensitivity was reached in 50% of patients, including 79% from the CHB-MIT database and 27% from the European epilepsy database. The median latency from seizure onset to its detection was 17 ± 10 s, with 84% of seizures being detected within 40 s.


SIGNIFICANCE
Personalized EEG signature combined with DTW appears to be a promising method to detect ictal events from a limited number of EEG channels with high sensitivity despite low rate of false alarms, high degree of interpretability, and low computational complexity, compatible with its future use in wearable devices.},

  abstract  = {The automatic seizure detection system can effectively help doctors to monitor and diagnose epilepsy thus reducing their workload. Many outstanding studies have given good results in the two-class seizure detection problems, but most of them are based on hand-wrought feature extraction. This study proposes an end-to-end automatic seizure detection system based on deep learning, which does not require heavy preprocessing on the EEG data or feature engineering. The fully convolutional network with three convolution blocks is first used to learn the expressive seizure characteristics from EEG data. Then these robust EEG features pertinent to seizures are presented as an input to the Nested Long Short-Term Memory (NLSTM) model to explore the inherent temporal dependencies in EEG signals. Lastly, the high-level features obtained from the NLSTM model are fed into the softmax layer to output predicted labels. The proposed method yields an accuracy range of 98.44-100% in 10 different experiments based on the Bonn University database. A larger EEG database is then used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real-life situations. The average sensitivity of 97.47%, specificity of 96.17%, and false detection rate of 0.487 per hour are yielded. For CHB-MIT Scalp EEG database, the proposed model also achieves a segment-level sensitivity of 94.07% with a false detection rate of 0.66 per hour. The excellent results obtained on three different EEG databases demonstrate that the proposed method has good robustness and generalization power under ideal and real-life conditions.},

  abstract     = {Multivariate time series classification is an important computational task arising in applications where data is recorded over time and over multiple channels. For example, a smartwatch can record the acceleration and orientation of a person's motion, and these signals are recorded as multivariate time series. We can classify this data to understand and predict human movement and various properties such as fitness levels. In many applications classification alone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the model learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information in the data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating explanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC). We focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most relevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. We analyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKET and dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. We study these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets and provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided. We find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channels works as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations of SHAP for MTSC work quite well. Additionally, we also find that the popular synthetic datasets we used are not suitable for time series analysis.},

The analysis of ictal EEG (scalp or intracranial) is a gold standard for definition of localization of epileptic focus. In order to automate visual analysis of large amounts of EEG data, we examine the correlations among electrodes captured by linear, nonlinear and multilinear data analysis techniques. We study the performance of these statistical tools to understand the complex structure of epilepsy seizure and localize seizure origin. Our analysis results on four patients with temporal lobe epilepsy reveal that multiway (Tucker3 [1]) and nonlinear multiway (Kernelized Tucker3) analysis techniques are capable of capturing epileptic focus precisely when validated with clinical findings whereas linear and nonlinear analysis techniques (SVD, Kernel PCA [2]) fail to localize seizure origin.},

  abstract = {Recently, Transformer-like deep architectures have shown strong performance on tabular data problems. Unlike traditional models, e.g., MLP, these architectures map scalar values of numerical features to high-dimensional embeddings before mixing them in the main backbone. In this work, we argue that embeddings for numerical features are an underexplored degree of freedom in tabular DL, which allows constructing more powerful DL models and competing with GBDT on some traditionally GBDT-friendly benchmarks. We start by describing two conceptually different approaches to building embedding modules: the first one is based on a piecewise linear encoding of scalar values, and the second one utilizes periodic activations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that these two approaches can lead to significant performance boosts compared to the embeddings based on conventional blocks such as linear layers and ReLU activations. Importantly, we also show that embedding numerical features is beneficial for many backbones, not only for Transformers. Specifically, after proper embeddings, simple MLP-like models can perform on par with the attention-based architectures. Overall, we highlight embeddings for numerical features as an important design aspect with good potential for further improvements in tabular DL.},

  abstract   = {We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework for epileptic seizure localization from scalp electroencephalography (EEG). Our architecture, SZLoc, extracts multi-resolution information via local (single channel) and global (cross-channel) CNN encodings. These interconnected representations are fused using a transformer layer. Leveraging its multi-resolution outputs, SZLoc derives three clinically interpretable outputs: electrode-level seizure activity, seizure onset zone localization, and identification of the EEG signal intervals that contribute to the final localization.  From an optimization standpoint, we formulate a novel ensemble of loss functions to train SZLoc using inexact spatial and temporal labels of seizure onset.  In this manner, SZLoc automatically learns phenomena at finer resolutions than the training labels. We validate our SZLoc framework and training paradigm on a clinical EEG dataset of 34 focal epilepsy patients.  As compared to other deep learning baseline models, SZLoc achieves robust inter-patient seizure localization performance.  We also demonstrate generalization of SZLoc to a second cohort of 16 epilepsy patients with different seizure characteristics and recorded at a different site. Taken together, SZLoc extends beyond the traditional paradigm of seizure detection by providing clinically relevant seizure localization information from coarse and inexact training labels.},

  abstract  = {Seizure detection from EEGs is a challenging and time-consuming clinical problem that would benefit from the development of automated algorithms. EEGs can be viewed as structural time series, because they are multivariate time series where the placement of leads on a patient’s scalp provides prior information about the structure of interactions. Commonly used deep learning models for time series do not offer a way to leverage structural information, but this would be desirable in a model for structural time series. To address this challenge, we propose the temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN), a model that leverages temporal and structural information and has relatively few parameters. TGCN applies feature extraction operations that are localized and shared over both time and space, thereby providing a useful inductive bias in tasks where similar features are expected to be discriminative across the different sequences. In our experiments we focus on metrics that are most important to seizure detection, and demonstrate that TGCN matches the performance of related models that have been shown to be state-of-the-art in other tasks. Additionally, we investigate interpretability advantages of TGCN by exploring approaches for helping clinicians determine when precisely seizures occur, and the parts of the brain that are most involved.},

Autoencoder (AE) und Variational Autoencoder (VAE) werden trainiert, um normale EEG-Muster zu lernen und Anomalien (IEDs) als Abweichungen von dieser Normalität zu identifizieren. Ein semi-überwachter Ansatz, der sowohl markierte als auch unmarkierte Daten nutzt, erzielt die **besten Ergebnisse mit einer Sensitivität von 81,9% und einer Spezifität von 91,7%** . Die Studie untersucht verschiedene Entscheidungsfindungskriterien und zeigt, dass ein **kombinierter Ansatz aus VAE und einem neuronalen Klassifikator die effektivste Methode** zur IED-Detektion darstellt.},
