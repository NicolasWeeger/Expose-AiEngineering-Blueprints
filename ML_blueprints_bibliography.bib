  abstract = {Method: We conduct an empirical study of ML-related developer posts on Stack Overflow. We perform in-depth quantitative and qualitative analyses focusing on a series of research questions related to the challenges of developing ML applications and the directions to address them. Results: Our findings include: (1) ML questions suffer from a much higher percentage of unanswered questions on Stack Overflow than other domains; (2) there is a lack of ML experts in the Stack Overflow QA community; (3) the data preprocessing and model deployment phases are where most of the challenges lay; and (4) addressing most of these challenges require more ML implementation knowledge than ML conceptual knowledge. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most challenges are under the data preparation and model deployment phases, i.e., early and late stages. Also, the implementation aspect of ML shows much higher difficulty level among developers than the conceptual aspect.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning have stimulated widespread interest within the Information Technology sector on integrating AI capabilities into software and services. This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components --- models may be ``entangled'' in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) systems are gaining popularity, reshaping various domains ranging from customer services to software engineering. The effectiveness of ML systems is dependent on the quality of their training data. Therefore, practitioners invest substantial time experimenting with different data, parameters, and models to guarantee the quality of the end system. Prior work highlighted unique challenges of developing ML systems, particularly concerning versioning data and models. Recently, various tools such as DVC and MLFlow have emerged to aid developers in the storage and tracking of data. Despite their growing popularity, very little is known about their usage patterns and impact on opensource software (OSS) systems. To address this gap, we conducted an empirical study on 56 GitHub OSS projects that use DVC to understand the DVC usage pattern and the impact of using DVC on the software development process. We found that Versioning and tracking is the most adopted DVC feature, being utilized by all 56 projects and being the only adopted feature in 85.7\% of them. Furthermore, we found that DVC has a significant impact on the software development process indicators such as the number of created pull requests (PRs), and the number of bug-fix commits. For instance, our findings showed that DVC causes a peak in the number of commits and PRs at the moment of the adoption, followed by a long-term decrease. We believe that our findings can assist practitioners in tailoring tools to better meet user requirements and help organizations realize potential outcomes of adopting such tools.},

  abstract = {Context] Applying design principles has long been acknowledged as beneficial for understanding and maintainability in traditional software projects. These benefits may similarly hold for Machine Learning (ML) projects, which involve iterative experimentation with data, models, and algorithms. However, ML components are often developed by data scientists with diverse educational backgrounds, potentially resulting in code that doesn't adhere to software design best practices. [Goal] In order to better understand this phenomenon, we investigated the impact of the SOLID design principles on ML code understanding. [Method] We conducted a controlled experiment with three independent trials involving 100 data scientists. We restructured real industrial ML code that did not use SOLID principles. Within each trial, one group was presented with the original ML code, while the other was presented with ML code incorporating SOLID principles. Participants of both groups were asked to analyze the code and fill out a questionnaire that included both open-ended and closed-ended questions on their understanding. [Results] The study results provide statistically significant evidence that the adoption of the SOLID design principles can improve code understanding within the realm of ML projects. [Conclusion] We put forward that software engineering design principles should be spread within the data science community and considered for enhancing the maintainability of ML code.},

Over the past few years, organizations are increasingly turning to AI in order to gain business value following a deluge of data and a strong increase in computational capacity. Nevertheless, organizations are still struggling to adopt and leverage AI in their operations. The lack of a coherent understanding of how AI technologies create business value, and what type of business value is expected, therefore necessitates a holistic understanding. This study provides a systematic literature review that attempts to explain how organizations can leverage AI technologies in their operations and elucidate the valuegenerating mechanisms. Our analysis synthesizes the current literature and highlights: (1) the key enablers and inhibitors of AI adoption and use; (2) the typologies of AI use in the organizational setting; and (3) the first- and second-order effects of AI. The paper concludes with an identification of the gaps in the literature and develops a research agenda that identifies areas that need to be addressed by future studies.},

Despite the intensive support for building ML applications, there are still challenges when it comes to evaluating, assuring, and improving the quality or dependability. The difficulty stems from the unique nature of ML: namely, that the system behavior is derived from training data, not from logical design by human engineers. This leads to black-box and intrinsically imperfect implementations that invalidate many of the existing principles and techniques in traditional software engineering. In light of this situation, the Japanese industry has jointly worked on a set of guidelines for the quality assurance of AI systems (in the QA4AI consortium) from the viewpoint of traditional quality-assurance engineers and test engineers. We report the initial version of these guidelines, which cover a list of the quality evaluation aspects, a catalogue of current state-of-the-art techniques, and domain-specific discussions in four representative domains. The guidelines provide significant insights for engineers in terms of methodologies and designs for tests driven by application-specific requirements.},

  abstract = {One of the main goals of an applied research field such as software engineering is the transfer and widespread use of research results in industry. To impact industry, researchers developing technologies in academia need to provide tangible evidence of the advantages of using them. This can be done trough step-wise validation, enabling researchers to gradually test and evaluate technologies to finally try them in real settings with real users and applications. The evidence obtained, together with detailed information on how the validation was conducted, offers rich decision support material for industry practitioners seeking to adopt new technologies and researchers looking for an empirical basis on which to build new or refined technologies. This paper presents model for evaluating the rigor and industrial relevance of technology evaluations in software engineering. The model is applied and validated in a comprehensive systematic literature review of evaluations of requirements engineering technologies published in software engineering journals. The aim is to show the applicability of the model and to characterize how evaluations are carried out and reported to evaluate the state-of-research. The review shows that the model can be applied to characterize evaluations in requirements engineering. The findings from applying the model also show that the majority of technology evaluations in requirements engineering lack both industrial relevance and rigor. In addition, the research field does not show any improvements in terms of industrial relevance over time.},

However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses this issue. MLOps includes several aspects, such as best practices, sets of concepts, and development culture. However, MLOps is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review, a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these investigations, we contribute to the body of knowledge by providing an aggregated overview of the necessary principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated architecture and workflows. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive definition of MLOps and highlight open challenges in the field. Finally, this work provides guidance for ML researchers and practitioners who want to automate and operate their ML products with a designated set of technologies.},

To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a reference architecture and requirements for MLOps by systematically reviewing 58 industrial gray literature articles.

Modern software development processes, such as DevOps, have widely been adopted and typically emphasise frequent development iterations and continuous delivery of software changes. Despite the ability of modern approaches in solving some of the problems faced when building ML-based software systems, there are no established procedures on how to combine them with processes in ML workflow in practice today. This paper points out the challenges in development of complex systems that include ML components, and discuss possible solutions driven by the combination of DevOps and ML workflow processes.

There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale MLbased systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research.},

To collect and analyze state-of-the-art knowledge about SE for AI-based systems, we conducted a systematic mapping study. We considered 248 studies published between January 2010 and March 2020. SE for AI-based systems is an emerging research area, where more than 2/3 of the studies have been published since 2018. The most studied properties of AI-based systems are dependability and safety. We identified multiple SE approaches for AI-based systems, which we classified according to the SWEBOK areas. Studies related to software testing and software quality are very prevalent, while areas like software maintenance seem neglected. Data-related issues are the most recurrent challenges. Our results are valuable for: researchers, to quickly understand the state of the art and learn which topics need more research; practitioners, to learn about the approaches and challenges that SE entails for AI-based systems; and, educators, to bridge the gap among SE and AI in their curricula.},

  abstract = {Background: The number of Machine Learning (ML) systems developed in the industry is increasing rapidly. Since ML systems are different from traditional systems, these differences are clearly visible in different activities pertaining to ML systems software development process. These differences make the Software Engineering (SE) activities more challenging for ML systems because not only the behavior of the system is data dependent, but also the requirements are data dependent. In such scenario, how can Software Engineering better support the development of ML systems? Aim: Our objective is twofold. First, better understand the process that developers use to build ML systems. Second, identify the main challenges that developers face, proposing ways to overcome these challenges. Method: We conducted interviews with seven developers from three software small companies that develop ML systems. Based on the challenges uncovered, we proposed a set of checklists to support the developers. We assessed the checklists by using a focus group. Results: We found that the ML systems development follow a 4-stage process in these companies. These stages are: understanding the problem, data handling, model building, and model monitoring. The main challenges faced by the developers are: identifying the clients' business metrics, lack of a defined development process, and designing the database structure. We have identified in the focus group that our proposed checklists provided support during identification of the client's business metrics and in increasing visibility of the progress of the project tasks. Conclusions: Our research is an initial step towards supporting the development of ML systems, suggesting checklists that support developers in essential development tasks, and also serve as a basis for future research in the area.},

  abstract = {The current approaches for energy consumption optimisation in buildings are mainly reactive or focus on scheduling of daily/weekly operation modes in heating. Machine Learning (ML)-based advanced control methods have been demonstrated to improve energy efficiency when compared to these traditional methods. However, placing of ML-based models close to the buildings is not straightforward. Firstly, edge-devices typically have lower capabilities in terms of processing power, memory, and storage, which may limit execution of ML-based inference at the edge. Secondly, associated building information should be kept private. Thirdly, network access may be limited for serving a large number of edge devices. The contribution of this paper is an architecture, which enables training of ML-based models for energy consumption prediction in private cloud domain, and transfer of the models to edge nodes for prediction in Kubernetes environment. Additionally, predictors at the edge nodes can be automatically updated without interrupting operation. Performance results with sensor-based devices (Raspberry Pi 4 and Jetson Nano) indicated that a satisfactory prediction latency ({\textasciitilde}7--9 s) can be achieved within the research context. However, model switching led to an increase in prediction latency ({\textasciitilde}9--13 s). Partial evaluation of a Reference Architecture for edge computing systems, which was used as a starting point for architecture design, may be considered as an additional contribution of the paper.},

  abstract = {Background: Augmented reality, computer vision and other (e.g. network functions, Internet-of-Things (IoT)) use cases can be realised in edge computing environments with machine learning (ML) techniques. For realisation of the use cases, it has to be understood how data is collected, stored, processed, analysed, and visualised in big data systems. In order to provide services with low latency for end users, often utilisation of ML techniques has to be optimized. Also, software/service developers have to understand, how to develop and deploy ML models in edge computing environments. Therefore, architecture design of big data systems to edge computing environments may be challenging. Findings: The contribution of this paper is reference architecture (RA) design of a big data system utilising ML techniques in edge computing environments. An earlier version of the RA has been extended based on 16 realised implementation architectures, which have been developed to edge/distributed computing environments. Also, deployment of architectural elements in different environments is described. Finally, a system view is provided of the software engineering aspects of ML model development and deployment. Conclusions: The presented RA may facilitate concrete architecture design of use cases in edge computing environments. The value of RAs is reduction of development and maintenance costs of systems, reduction of risks, and facilitation of communication between different stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Purpose. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a crucial role in the global economy, yet they often face significant challenges in implementing cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) due to limited resources and expertise. This study aims to address this gap by identifying the most important applications of AI for SMEs, exploring their benefits and challenges and assessing their impact on business processes. Design/methodology/approach. A quantitative research approach was employed, including an online survey distributed through various social media platforms. The survey, which was conducted in May 2023, used a standardized questionnaire with closed-ended questions. The survey data were analysed using statistical methods to identify patterns and trends in AI adoption among German SMEs, with a particular focus on their experiences, challenges, and perceived benefits of AI implementation. Findings. The results of this study highlight the most important AI applications for SMEs in various professions and business activities, including virtual assistants, recommendation systems, and machine learning. The study also highlights the benefits of these applications, such as improved efficiency, productivity, and decision-making, as well as the challenges they present, such as privacy concerns and the need for specialized skills. Research limitations/implications. The study is limited by the sample size and the self-reported data collected through an online survey. The findings may not be generalizable to all industries and regions. The implications of this study are that SMEs need to carefully consider the potential benefits and challenges of AI before implementing it in their processes. Originality/value. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the most important AI applications for SMEs and their impact on business processes. Thus, this research serves scientists as a theoretical basis for future research in the field of AI implementation in SMEs. Furthermore, the findings have practical implications for SMEs considering implementing AI in their operations.},

  abstract = {Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building useful complex prediction systems quickly. This paper argues it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering framework of technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors to account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.},

  abstract = {Background. The increasing reliance on applications with machine learning (ML) components calls for mature engineering techniques that ensure these are built in a robust and future-proof manner. Aim. We aim to empirically determine the state of the art in how teams develop, deploy and maintain software with ML components. Method. We mined both academic and grey literature and identified 29 engineering best practices for ML applications. We conducted a survey among 313 practitioners to determine the degree of adoption for these practices and to validate their perceived effects. Using the survey responses, we quantified practice adoption, differentiated along demographic characteristics, such as geography or team size. We also tested correlations and investigated linear and non-linear relationships between practices and their perceived effect using various statistical models. Results. Our findings indicate, for example, that larger teams tend to adopt more practices, and that traditional software engineering practices tend to have lower adoption than ML specific practices. Also, the statistical models can accurately predict perceived effects such as agility, software quality and traceability, from the degree of adoption for specific sets of practices. Combining practice adoption rates with practice importance, as revealed by statistical models, we identify practices that are important but have low adoption, as well as practices that are widely adopted but are less important for the effects we studied. Conclusion. Overall, our survey and the analysis of responses received provide a quantitative basis for assessment and step-wise improvement of practice adoption by ML teams.},

The classification is done based on the design principles that need to be adhered for a standard design and architectural patterns. ML based applications generally have ubiquitous modules to some extent. However, modeling their components through varied design patterns bring out positive changes to the performance of the systems as well as mitigates many of the computational shortcomings faced otherwise. Although it is still a novel approach for systems implementing machine learning algorithms, the paper aims to bring a new paradigm in analyzing system models.},

ML Operations (MLOps) represents an effective strategy for bringing ML models from academic resources to useful tools for solving problems in the corporate world. The current literature on MLOps is still mostly disconnected and sporadic. In this work, we review the existing scientific literature and we propose a taxonomy for clustering research papers on MLOps. In addition, we present methodologies and operations aimed at defining an ML pipeline to simplify the release of ML applications in the industry. The pipeline is based on ten steps: business problem understanding, data acquisition, ML methodology, ML training \& testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous training, continuous monitoring, explainability, and sustainability. The scientific and business interest and the impact of MLOps have grown significantly over the past years: the definition of a clear and standardized methodology for conducting MLOps projects is the main contribution of this paper.},

Although there exist tools to support dataset and model developers in managing ML artifacts, little is known about how these datasets and models are integrated into ML applications. In this paper, we study how datasets and models in ML applications are managed. In particular, we focus on how these artifacts are stored and versioned alongside the applications. After analyzing 93 repositories, we identified the most common storage location to store datasets and models is the file system, which causes availability issues. Notably, large data and model files, exceeding approximately 60 MB, are stored exclusively in remote storage and downloaded as needed. Most of the datasets and models lack proper integration with the version control system, posing potential traceability and reproducibility issues. Additionally, although datasets and models are likely to evolve during the application development, they are rarely updated in application repositories.},
